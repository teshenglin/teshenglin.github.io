The absolute value of the vertical acceleration should not exceed a constant $k$ (which is much less than the acceleration due to gravity)\nQuestion 1: Find a cubic polynomial $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ that satisfies condition (i) by imposing suitable conditions on $P(x)$ and $P’(x)$ at the start of descent and at touchdown.\nAnswer: At the start of descent: $$ P(\\ell) = al^3 +b\\ell^2 +c\\ell+d = h, \\qquad P’(\\ell) = 3a\\ell^2 +2b\\ell+c = 0. $$ At touchdown: $$ P(0) = 0 \\Longrightarrow d = 0, \\qquad P’(0)=0 \\Longrightarrow c=0. $$ Solve for $a$, $b$ in terms of $h$, $\\ell$ we find $$ P(x) = −\\frac{2h}{\\ell^3}x^3 + \\frac{3h}{\\ell^2}x^2. $$\nQuestion 2: Use conditions (ii) and (iii) to show that $\\frac{6hv^2}{\\ell^2}\\le k$.\nAnswer: From (ii), a constant horizontal speed $v$ is assumed throughout descent, we can then express $x$ as $$ x = \\ell - vt, \\qquad t\\in[0, \\frac{\\ell}{v}], $$ where the minus sign indicating flying to the left. The polynomial $P$ can then be re-written in terms of variable $t$ as $$ P(t) = −\\frac{2h}{\\ell^3}(\\ell - vt)^3 + \\frac{3h}{\\ell^2}(\\ell - vt)^2, \\qquad \\frac{d^2t}{dt^2}P(t) = −\\frac{12hv^2}{\\ell^3}(\\ell - vt) + \\frac{6hv^2}{\\ell^2}. $$ Therefore, the vertical acceleration $a$ is $$ a(t) = \\left|−\\frac{12hv^3}{\\ell^3}(\\ell - vt) + \\frac{6hv^2}{\\ell^2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{12hv^3}{\\ell^3}\\,t - \\frac{6hv^2}{\\ell^2}\\right|, \\qquad t\\in[0, \\frac{\\ell}{v}]. $$ It can be check, from the Extreme Value Theorem and closed interval method, that $a$ attains it\u0026rsquo;s maximum value and the value is $\\frac{6hv^2}{\\ell^2}$.

If the cruising altitude of a plane is $35,000(ft)$ and the speed is $300(mi/h)$, how far away from the airport should the pilot start descent?\nAnswer:\nGiven $P(x) = −\\frac{2h}{\\ell^3}x^3 + \\frac{3h}{\\ell^2}x^2$, suppose the pilot starts to descend when the plane is $\\ell(mi)$ from the airport. In Q2. we know that $\\frac{6hv^2}{\\ell^2}\\le k$.

So the fixed point is unique.\nconvergence of fixed point iteration Finally, again, based on MVT we have $$|x_{n+1} - c| = |f(x_n) - f(c )| = |f\u0026rsquo;(c_i)(x_n-c)|\\leq\\alpha |x_n-c|\\leq\\alpha^n|x_1-c|\\to 0.$$\n 所以如果在固定點 $c$ 的微分小於 $1$, 那就存在一個包含 $c$ 的小區間使得函數的微分都在這區間內小於 $1$, 那根據這定理固定點迭代就會收斂.\n固定點迭代是求根問題(root finding problems)中很重要的一種迭代方式. 舉個例子來說, 假設我們想要找 $g(x)$ 這個函數的根, 那我們可以定義 $$ f(x) = x + g(x). $$ 這樣的話 $f$ 的固定點就會是 $g$ 的根了. 不過跟上面一樣, 這樣的定義方式有無窮多種, 哪種是最好的? 其中一個最有名的就是牛頓法 (Newton\u0026rsquo;s method):\n Newton\u0026rsquo;s iteration $$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{g(x_n)}{g\u0026rsquo;(x_n)}.$$\n 我們可以定義 $f(x) = x - \\frac{g(x)}{g\u0026rsquo;(x)}$, 這樣上面這個式子就是個固定點迭代. 接著我們可以發現, 如果 $c$ 是 $g$ 函數的根, 也就是 $g(c )=0$, 那 $f\u0026rsquo;(c ) = 0$. 所以根據上面的定理就存在某個包含 $c$ 的小區間使得迭代會收斂.\n更進一步我們可以利用泰勒展開式(Taylor\u0026rsquo;s series expansion) 來證明牛頓法事實上有二次收斂, $$ |x_{n+1} - c| \\approx \\beta |x_n-c|^2. $$ 這個證明我們這邊就先略過不寫. 不過接著我們來看一下牛頓法究竟有多快.

The particle sets into motion at a critical Pe. Whereas the particle trajectory is straight at a small enough Pe, it is found that it loses its stability at a critical Pe in favor of a meandering motion. When Pe is increased further, the particle meanders at a short scale but its trajectory wraps into a circle at a larger scale. Increasing even further, Pe causes the swimmer to escape momentarily the circular trajectory in favor of chaotic motion, which lasts for a certain time, before regaining a circular trajectory, and so on. The chaotic bursts become more and more frequent as Pe increases, until the trajectory becomes fully chaotic, via the intermittency scenario. The statistics of the trajectory is found to be of the run-and-tumble-like nature at a short enough time and of diffusive nature at a long time without any source of noise.","tags":[],"title":"Chaotic swimming of phoretic self-propelled particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Te-Sheng Lin (林得勝)"],"categories":["notes"],"content":"  這裡我們要介紹 julia 這個程式語言. 這是一個非常新的語言, 在 2009 年才問世, 遠比 1990 年出生的 python 來的年輕許多. 不過由於它又快又簡單, 又不用錢, 使得目前有越來越多人開始使用這個新語言. 相信未來會更加普及.\n Julia 安裝 在 Julia 官方網站 上可以下載各系統平台的安裝包裹. 下載安裝後即可運行.\n Julia 安裝教學影片可參考 Julia課程環境簡介 on Youtube\n 如果只想試用一下的話可以試試 repl.it 這個線上編輯器. 它可以讓你在線上編輯並執行一些簡單的 julia 程式.\n 如果平常會寫各式程式語言, 可以考慮加安裝 atom 編輯器. 它是 github 開發的免費編輯器, 不管 Mac, windows 或是 Linux 都有支援. 我自己有使用 atom 來寫 julia, fortran, html 等.\n  Julia 基本簡介與語法教學  Julia: wikibook\n Julia Taiwan發起人杜岳華的 slideshare: Introduction to Julia\n Julia 中文官方文件草稿\n  Julia 基本簡介  查詢版本資訊\njulia\u0026gt; versioninfo()  套件(package)管理\njulia\u0026gt; ]  然後就會進入套件管理系統\n(vX.X) pkg\u0026gt;  查詢已安裝套件\n(vX.X) pkg\u0026gt; status  更新套件\n(vX.X) pkg\u0026gt; update  跳出系統請按鍵盤上的刪除鍵.\n 查詢指令(如matlab中的help)\njulia\u0026gt; ?  然後就會變成查詢的視窗\nhelp?\u0026gt;   Jupyter notebook 安裝  Jupyter notebook 是個互動式筆記本, 很容易可以逐行執行並且做到資料視覺化, 並且支援多種主流的直譯語言像是 Julia, python, R. 有一說是 jupyter 這個字事實上就是由 julia, python 以及 R 這三個字組合而成.\n 安裝 Jupyter notebook 有兩種方式. 第一種是直接由 julia 安裝. 步驟如下\n在 julia 輸入 ] 進入套件管理命令提示. 然後會長得像這樣\n(v1.1) pkg\u0026gt;  接著輸入 status 可以看到現在已經安裝的套件.\n我們要安裝 IJulia, 所以輸入\n(v1.1) pkg\u0026gt; add IJulia  安裝完後要退出套件管理則是 BackSpace 鍵或是 Ctrl+C 都可以.\n要打開 notebook 需要退出套件管理, 並在 julia 命令提示字元下輸入\njulia\u0026gt; using IJulia julia\u0026gt; notebook()  這樣 Jupyter notebook 就會在你的瀏覽器中打開.\n 若還是有不清楚的地方請見 安裝及建置 Julia 開發環境實戰教學  安裝 Jupyter notebook 的第二種方式則是透過 anaconda. 先裝完 julia 後下載 anaconda 安裝, 即可快樂使用.\n 若還是有不清楚的地方請見 打造 Jupyter Notebook 資料科學環境\n 目前已經有 jupyter notebook 的升級版, 稱為 jupyter lab. 以 conda 安裝完成後在 julia 命令提示字元下輸入\njulia\u0026gt; using IJulia julia\u0026gt; jupyterlab()  這樣 Jupyter lab 就會在你的瀏覽器中打開.\n  Youtube 上的 Julia 超新手教學  Julia Taiwan 超新手教學之一 on github\n Julia Taiwan 超新手教學之二 on Youtube\n Julia Taiwan 超新手教學之三 on Youtube\n  ","date":1572307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574041585,"objectID":"2910f7715785e18cfda6cb07d9fa806b","permalink":"https://teshenglin.github.io/post/2019_julia/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_julia/","section":"post","summary":"這裡我們要介紹 julia 這個程式語言. 這是一個非常新的語言, 在 2009 年才問世, 遠比 1990 年出生的 python 來的年輕許多. 不過由於它又快又簡單, 又不用錢, 使得目前有越","tags":["julia"],"title":"Julia 學習筆記","type":"post"},{"authors":["Te-Sheng Lin (林得勝)"],"categories":["notes"],"content":"  這裡我們要介紹 markdown 這個語言. 它非常簡單易學, 有時我們只是想打個小文件, 就幾頁而已不想要開 latex 或是 word 之類的文字編輯軟體, 這時候就非常適合以 markdown 來編寫. 另外其實越來越多的程式語言也支援 markdown 編寫. 比如這個網頁裡的 post 就都是以 markdown 做的.\n Markdown 安裝  我自己是使用 mac, 我用的是 MacDown 這個軟體.\n 安裝完 Macdown 之後需要到 Preference/Rendering 中標選 tex-like math 以及他下一行的 use dollar sign as xxxx, 才可使用 tex 語法.

I will leave it as an exercise.\n最後再補充一點, 函數在某個點連續但是微分不存在有幾種情形:\n 尖點. 例如 $f(x) = |x|$ 在 $x=0$ 時.\n 垂直切線. 例如 $f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ 在 $x=0$ 時.\n 微分定義中的極限不存在. 例如 $f(x) = x\\sin(x)$ 在 $x=0$ 時.\n  ","date":1572307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572422772,"objectID":"52cf3fef489e9133b1d7fbcae569d371","permalink":"https://teshenglin.github.io/post/2019_maxmin/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_maxmin/","section":"post","summary":"這裡我們要討論一個函數的最大值以及最小值. 首先我們有極值定理 Theorem: Extreme value theorem If $f$ is a real-valued continuous function on the closed interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ must attain a maximum and a minimum. 所以對於定義在封閉區間的連續函","tags":["extreme","function","continuous","differentiable"],"title":"Maximum and minimum of a function","type":"post"},{"authors":["Te-Sheng Lin (林得勝)"],"categories":["Calculus"],"content":"  這裡我們要介紹 slant asymptotes, 也就是所謂的斜漸近線.\n Section 1: slant asymptotes 斜漸近線定義如下: The line $y=mx+b$, $m\\ne 0$, is called a slant asymptote of $f(x)$ if $$ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} [f(x) - (mx+b)] = 0. $$\nRemark: 亦可將上列式子中改為 $x\\to-\\infty$. 滿足此條件的也是斜漸近線. 所以斜漸近線最多有兩條.\nSection 1.1: 長除法 要求得斜漸近線的方法其中之一是長除法. 例如以下這個函數 $$ f(x) = \\frac{4x^3-10x^2-11x+1}{x^2-3x}. $$ 將這個函數的分子與分母做長除法發現 $$ 4x^3-10x^2-11x+1 = (4x+2)(x^2-3x) + (-5x+1), $$ 也就是說 $$ f(x) = (4x+2) + \\frac{-5x+1}{x^2-3x}. $$ 這樣我們很明顯可以看出來 $$ \\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty} [f(x) - (4x+2)] = \\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty} \\frac{-5x+1}{x^2-3x} = 0. $$ 所以 $y=4x+2$ 就是這個函數的斜漸近線.\nSection 1.2: 直接法 不過如果遇到無法做長除法的函數, 以上的招數就失效了. 例如 $$ g(x) = \\sqrt{x^2-1}+3, $$ 就無法以長除法來找斜漸近線.\n我們先觀察一下原本斜漸近線的定義, 然後很快就可以發現, 如果 $y=mx+b$ 是一條斜漸近線則我們有 $$ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{x} = m. $$ 所以透過以上這個式子我們可以找到斜漸近線中的第一個參數 $m$. 知道這個參數之後我們一樣再把原本定義改寫一下則有 $$ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} [f(x) - mx] = b. $$ 利用這個式子就可以找到斜漸近線中的第二個參數 $b$.\n我們以上面的 $g(x)$ 函數為例來找一下它的斜漸近線.\n 首先第一步我們先看一下 $g(x)$ 在正負無窮遠的行為: $$ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g(x) = \\infty, \\quad \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} g(x) = \\infty. $$ 發現它會趨近無窮大, 所以有機會有斜漸近線.\nRemark:\n 如果趨近一個常數那就會得到橫漸近線 (horizontal asymptotes), 那就沒有斜漸近線. 如果極限不是正負無窮大其中之一, 那也不可能會有斜漸近線. 以上都是在講單邊 ($x\\to\\infty$, 或是 $x\\to -\\infty$), 有可能兩邊行為完全不一樣.  接著我們試著求出 $m$: $$ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{g(x)}{x} = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-1}+3}{x} = 1. $$ 所以 $m=1$. 接著我們求解 $b$: $$ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} [g(x) - mx] = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\left[\\sqrt{x^2-1}+3 - x\\right] = 3. $$ 所以 $b=3$.\nRemark:\n 同樣做法可以得到 $x\\to -\\infty$ 時我們有 $m=-1$, $b=3$.  因此我們得到 $g(x)$ 在正無窮遠處的斜漸近線為 $y=x+3$, 在負無窮遠處的斜漸近線為 $y=-x+3$.\n  Section 1.3: Summary 總結一下:\n 斜漸近線可以用長除法或直接法求得.  不過不管長除法或直接法都是求出斜漸近線的計算過程. 實際上不管用哪種方法做, 長除法, 直接法, 或是當你很有經驗時可以一眼看出來, 要證明你所得到的直線是斜漸近線就是要驗證最初的定義是否正確. 也就是要驗證以下這個式子是對的: $$ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} [f(x) - (mx+b)] = 0. $$ 如果是對的, 你就得到它了.\n","date":1572307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572422772,"objectID":"28de2566daf41386d05e5487ac57d515","permalink":"https://teshenglin.github.io/post/2019_slant_asymp/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_slant_asymp/","section":"post","summary":"這裡我們要介紹 slant asymptotes, 也就是所謂的斜漸近線.

The flow structures are analysed first using a long-wave model, which is valid in the presence of weak inertia, and second using the Stokes equations. For obtuse angles, gravity is destabilising and solitary pulses exist even in the absence of an electric field. For acute angles, spatially non-uniform solutions exist only beyond a critical value of the electric field strength; moreover, solitary-pulse solutions are present only at sufficiently high supercritical electric-field strengths. The electric field increases the amplitude of the pulses, can generate recirculation zones in the humps and alters the far-field decay of the pulse tails from exponential to algebraic with a significant impact on pulse interactions. A weak-interaction theory predicts an infinite sequence of bound-state solutions for non-electrified flow, and a finite set for electrified flow. The existence of single-hump pulse solutions and two-pulse bound states is confirmed for the Stokes equations via boundary-element computations. In addition, the electric field is shown to trigger a switch from absolute to convective instability, thereby regularising the dynamics, and this is confirmed by time-dependent simulations of the long-wave model.","tags":[],"title":"Two-dimensional pulse dynamics and the formation of bound states on electrified falling films","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.-S.

Such a system can be considered as a prototype for many other systems where the interplay of spatial heterogeneity and a lateral driving force in the proximity of a first- or second-order phase transition results in intri- cate behavior. So does a partially wetting drop on a rotating cylinder undergo a depinning transition as the rotation speed is increased, whereas for ideally wetting liquids, the behavior only changes quantitatively. We analyze the bifurcations that occur when the rotation speed is increased for several values of the equilibrium contact angle of the partially wetting liquids. This allows us to discuss how the entire bifurcation structure and the flow behavior it encodes change with changing wettability. We employ various numerical continuation techniques that allow us to track stable/unstable steady and time-periodic film and drop thickness profiles. We support our findings by time-dependent numerical simulations and asymptotic analyses of steady and time-periodic profiles for large rotation numbers.","tags":[],"title":"Bifurcation analysis of the behavior of partially wetting liquids on a rotating cylinder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Transversally invariant ridges located on the more wettable stripes are identified as very important transient states and their linear stability is analyzed accompanied by direct numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear evolution equation for two-dimensional substrates. It is found that there exist two different instability modes that lead to different nonlinear evolutions that result (i) at large ridge volume in the formation of bulges that spill from the more wettable stripes onto the less wettable bare substrate and (ii) at small ridge volume in the formation of small droplets located on the more wettable stripes. In addition, the influence of different transport mechanisms during redistribution is investigated focusing on the cases of convective transport with no-slip at the substrate, transport via diffusion in the film bulk and via diffusion at the film surface. In particular, it is shown that the transport process does neither influence the linear stability thresholds nor the sequence of morphologies observed in the time simulation, but only the ratio of the time scales of the different process phases.","tags":[],"title":"Instabilities of layers of deposited molecules on chemically stripe patterned substrates: Ridges vs. drops","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

As for the local generalized Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (gKS) equation (see, e.g., [T. Kawahara and S. Toh, Phys.

We analyze the asymptotic characteristics of such pulses and show that their tails tend to zero al- gebraically but not exponentially, as for the local gKS equation. Since the Shilnikov-type approach is not applicable for analyzing bound states in nonlocal equations, we develop a weak-interaction theory and show that the standard first-neighbor approximation is no longer applicable. It is then essential to take into account long-range interactions due to the algebraic decay of the tails of the pulses. In addition, we find that the number of possible bound states for fixed parameter values is always finite, and we determine when there is long-range attractive or repulsive force between the pulses. Finally, we explain the regularizing effect of dispersion by showing that, as dispersion is increased, the pulses generally undergo a transition from absolute to convective instability. We also find that for some nonlocal operators, increasing the strength of the stabilizing/destabilizing term can have a regularizing/deregularizing effect on the dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Coherent structures in non-local dispersive active-dissipative systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Often the difficulties come from uncertainty or randomness in the data, e.g., in groundwater flow from permeability that is rapidly varying and uncertain, or in heat transport from uncertainty in the conductivity. These high dimensional problems present major challenges to computational resources, and requires serious mathematical efforts in devising new and effective methods.\nThis talk will provide a contemporary review of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for approximating high dimensional integrals. I will highlight some recent developments on \"lattice rules\" and \"higher order digital nets\". One key element is the \"fast component-by-component construction\" which yields QMC methods with a prescribed rate of convergence for sufficiently smooth functions. Another key element is the careful selection of parameters called \"weights\" to ensure that the worst case errors in an appropriately weighted function space are bounded independently of the dimension. Then I will showcase how this modern QMC theory can be tuned for a number of applications, including PDEs with random coefficients.\nReferences\n[1] J. Dick, F. Y. Kuo, and I. H.

Fukaya conjectures the Witten deformation of these higher product structures have semi-classical limits as operators defined by counting gradient flow trees with respect to Morse functions, which generalizes the remarkable Witten deformation of deRham differential. We will describe briefly the proof of Fukaya's conjecture, and an application to Mirror symmetry which realizes the scattering diagram as semi-classical limit of solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation.\n   Sep. 27, Yunping Jiang Title: \"混沌動態系統和複動態系統的介紹\" Abstract: 混沌動態系統和複動態系統是近十幾年來動態系統理論中非常活躍的分支。在此次講座中我將對混沌動態系統和複動態系統的起源和歷史作一簡短的回顧和分析，並對複動態系統中一些已知及待解的重要問題進行介紹和評論。\n   Sep. 27, Bing Li Title: \"The dimension drop problem for self-affine sets\" Abstract: The IFS (iterated function system) is a usual way to generate fractals.

Shape, frequency and amplitude responses of the drops are investigated for individual modes. The observations are characterized by relating to Rayleigh-Lamb (RL), Bostwick-Steen invisid (BS inviscid) and Bostwick-Steen viscous potential flow (VPF) theories. Observed mode shapes are compared to predictions from RL and BS inviscid theories via ray-tracing simulation. The comparison of frequency response suggests that VPF theory most adequately predicts resonance frequency of observed modes. The adequacy implies the necessity of considering both substrate constraint and viscosity, and hence distinguishes viscous sessile drops from and inviscid free spherical drops. The amplitude responses of modes are explored from the growth and decay of the lowest axisymmetric mode. Evident nonlinearity is observed. The amplitude study thus exposes the surprising extent to which our nonlinear observations can be understood in the context of linear theories. Further exploration reveals the interactions of modes such as spectral crossing and mode mixing. For subhemispherical drops, typical observations are mixtures of a half-frequency subharmonic non-zonal mixing a harmonic zonal mode. For superhemispherical drops, more diverse mixing phenomena are discovered. From the scientific perspective, the study reveals a rich collection of resonance modes catagorized according to shapes and harmonic types for future investigation. From engineers, the study provides guidelines for applications relevant to pattern selection of surface waves, such as ordered self-assembly of particles, droplet transport, drop atomization, enhanced mixing, and suspension collection.\n   Oct. 25, Ming-Yi Lee Title: \"Characterization of Campanato spaces associated with parabolic sections\" Abstract:  In this talk, we will study the Campanato spaces $\\Lambda^{\\kappa}_{q, \\mathcal P}$ and Hardy spaces $H^p_{\\mathcal P}$ associated with a family $\\mathcal P$ of parabolic sections which is closely related to the parabolic Monge-Amp\\`ere equation. Moreover, we show the Campanato spaces are the duals of the corresponding Hardy spaces.\n   Nov. 8, Wei-Hsuan Yu Title: \"New bounds for equiangular lines and spherical two-distance sets\" Abstract: The set of points in a metric space is called an $s$-distance set if pairwise distances between these points admit only $s$ distinct values. Two-distance spherical sets with the set of scalar products $\\{\\alpha, -\\alpha\\}$, $\\alpha\\in[0,1)$, are called equiangular. The problem of determining the maximal size of $s$-distance sets in various spaces has a long history in mathematics. We determine a new method of bounding the size of an $s$-distance set in two-point homogeneous spaces via zonal spherical functions. This method allows us to prove that the maximum size of a spherical two-distance set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $\\frac{n(n+1)}2$ with possible exceptions for some $n=(2k+1)^2-3$, $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We also prove the universal upper bound $\\sim \\frac 2 3 n a^2$ for equiangular sets with $\\alpha=\\frac 1 a$ and, employing this bound, prove a new upper bound on the size of equiangular sets in an arbitrary dimension. Finally, we classify all equiangular sets reaching this new bound.\n   Nov. 15, Chang-Hong Wu Title: \"On a free boundary problem for a reaction-diffusion-advection logistic model in heterogeneous environment\" Abstract: In this talk, we would like to introduce a reaction–diffusion–advection equation with a free boundary. This model may be used to describe the spreading of an invasive species in one-dimensional heterogeneous environments. We assume that the species has a tendency to move upward along the resource gradient in addition to random dispersal, and the spreading mechanism of species is determined by a Stefan-type condition. We are mainly interested in the effect of the inhomogeneous advection. Some biological implications will be discussed. This is a joint work with Harunori Monobe.\n   Nov. 22, Michael Drmota Title: \"Vertex Degrees in Planar Maps\" Abstract: We consider the family of rooted planar maps $M_\\Omega$ where the vertex degrees belong to a (possibly infinite) set of positive integers $\\Omega$. Using a classical bijection with mobiles and some refined analytic tools in order to deal with the systems of equations that arise, we recover a universal asymptotic behavior of planar maps. Furthermore we establish that the number of vertices of a given degree satisfies a multi (or even infinitely)-dimensional central limit theorem. This is joint work with Gwendal Collet and Lukas Klausner.\n   Nov. 22, Cyril Banderier Title: \"From algebraic to differential-algebraic functions in combinatorics\" Abstract: Asymptotics of recurrences is the key to get the typical properties of combinatorial structures, and thus the complexity of many algorithms relying on these structures. The associated generating function often follows a linear differential equation: we are here in the so-called \"D-finite\" world. For the matters of asymptotics, this case of linear recurrences (with polynomial coefficients) is well covered by the \"Analytic Combinatorics\" book of Flajolet and Sedgewick (though the computations of constants is still a challenge, related to the theory of Kontsevich-Zagier periods and evaluation of G-functions and E-functions). At the border of this D-finite world, lies \"algebraic-differential functions\". The terminology is not yet fixed and similar terms are used, up to a permutation, by several authors: let dz^m be the m-th derivative of F(z), the function is said \"algebraic-differential\" if there a exists a polynomial P such that P(z,F,F',..., dz^m F)=0. For all these worlds, having some positive (integer) coefficients leads to some strong constraints on the asymptotics (these is now well understood for algebraic function), and we try to see what happens in a more general setting.\nWe will give examples of such functions (motivated by some combinatorial problems), and show how a symbolic combinatorics approach can help for automatic asymptotics of their coefficients, and some open related open questions/challenges for computer algebra (joint works with Michael Drmota and Hsien-Kuei Hwang)\n   Dec. 6, Wei-Chao Chen Title: \"Smarter Places: Bridging Robotic Intelligence and Human Decision\" Abstract: We live in an era of ubiquitous network-connected sensors. We use cameras, sensors and switches to make buildings smarter, and places more responsive. However, it remains a huge challenge to design, configure and extend a system such that we can gather relevant information from these devices. How do we make devices communicate and work together, in this era of rapidly changing standards and technologies? How do we design a coherent user experience such that these devices do not place additional burden to the users? And do we need a new robotic intelligence manifesto for these smart places? In this talk we discuss the status and challenges in the general field of video surveillance, and our current progress toward answering these questions at Skywatch. These include technologies and services to enable reliable capture of both video and IoT sensor data, and algorithms for extracting sensible information from these unstructured data. We will also provide a hint about future directions we are moving toward to.\n   Dec. 13, Ian H. Sloan Title: \"High-dimensional integration of functions with kinks and jumps\" Abstract: In many applications, including option pricing, integrals of $d$-variate functions with ``kinks'' or ``jumps'' are encountered. (Kinks describe simple discontinuities in the derivative, jumps describe simple discontinuities in function values.) The standard analyses of sparse grid or Quasi Monte Carlo methods fail completely in the presence of kinks or jumps, yet the observed performance of these methods can remain reasonable.\nIn recent joint papers with Michael Griebel and Frances Kuo we sought an explanation by showing that many terms of the ANOVA expansion of a function with kinks can be smooth, because of the smoothing effect of integration. The problem settings have included both the unit cube and $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. The underlying idea is that integration of a non-smooth function with respect to a well chosen variable, say $x_j$, can result in a smooth function of $d-1$ variables.\nIn still more recent joint work with Andreas Griewank, Hernan Leovey and Frances Kuo we have extended the theoretical results from kinks to jumps, and have turned ``preintegration'' into a practical method for evaluating integrals of some non-smooth functions over $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. In this talk I will explain the concept of the ANOVA decomposition, the reason for smoothness in the ANOVA decomposition, and the method of ``smoothing by preintegration''.\n   Dec. 20, Li Su Title: \"Mining non-steady and overlapped periodicities from data streams: applications in audio, music, and biomedical signal processing\" Abstract: How to recognize and model domain knowledge from data, and how to generate data representations comprehensive and helpful for experts and learners are challenging issues in combining artificial intelligence technology and expertise. Abundant information related to domain knowledge is usually interpreted and utilized in specific manners according to a small amount of observations, and the observation usually contains overlapped patterns and non-steady behaviors. Such tasks are hardly scalable because of the complexity of ground truth and the insufficiency of rigorously labeled datasets. Periodicity is arguably one of the most fundamental features in data streams. In particular, finding and extracting every oscillating component which has non-steady periods and oscillating patterns from multi-component data streams is still an open problem. In this talk, a newly proposed approach for mining non-steady periodicities is introduced. This approach includes the combined frequency and periodicity (CFP) method, the de-shaped short-time Fourier transform (STFT), together with an optimization approach for pattern extraction. The approach is reported useful and efficient in challenging problems including automatic music transcription for music information retrieval (MIR), motion artifact reduction in plethysmograph (PPG) signals, the separation of fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, and other problems in future interdisciplinary technologies.\n   Dec. 27, Yunping Jiang Title: \"混沌動態系統和複動態系統的介紹\" Abstract: 混沌動態系統和複動態系統是近十幾年來動態系統理論中非常活躍的分支。在此次講座中我將對混沌動態系統和複動態系統的起源和歷史作一簡短的回顧和分析，並對複動態系統中一些已知及待解的重要問題進行介紹和評論。\n   Jan. 10, Justin W.L. Wan Title: \"Numerical linear algebra approach to cell image segmentation\" Abstract: Segmentation of cells in time-lapse bright-field microscopic images is crucial in understanding cell behaviors for medical research. However, the complex nature of the cells, together with poor contrast, broken cell boundaries and the halo artifact, pose nontrivial challenges to this problem. In this talk, we present two robust mathematical models based on linear algebra techniques to segment bright-field cells automatically. These models treat cell image segmentation as a background subtraction problem, which can be formulated as a robust Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) problem which minimizes the rank of the image matrix. Our first segmentation model is formulated as a PCP with nonnegative constraints. In this approach, we exploit the sparse component of the PCP solution for identifying the cell pixels. However, the sparse component and the nonzero entries can scatter all over the image, resulting in a noisy segmentation. The second model is an improvement of the first model by combining PCP with spectral clustering. Spectral clustering makes use of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix to classify data. Seemingly unrelated approaches, we combine the two techniques by incorporating normalized-cut in the PCP as a measure for the quality of the segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are effective in segmenting cells obtained from bright-field images.

Asymptotic properties of stationary Navier-Stokes flows in the setting of two dimension hyperbolic spaces   Abstracts  Speaker Title and abstract   Feb. 23, Rulin Kuan Title: \"Enclosure methods: a reconstruction method in inverse problems\" Abstract: Inverse problems contain many topics. One of them is to reconstruct unknown inclusions by using a non-invasive method. Enclosure method is one such reconstruction method. In this talk, I will briefly introduce the idea of enclosure method and take two models as examples to show some difficulties encountered. One model is the Lame system, which is an isotropic elastic system; the other is the anisotropic Maxwell system.\n   Mar. 1, Jyy-I (Joy) Hong Title: \"An application of the coalescence theory to branching random walks\" Abstract: When a population grows old, it is always interesting to know what happened to it in the past. The coalescence problem provides a way to understand the ancestry of the individuals in the population. We consider a rapidly-growing Galton-Watson branching process and pick two individuals in the current generation by simple random sampling without replacement and trace their lines of descent backward in time till they meet for the first time. We call the common ancestor of these chosen individuals at the coalescent time their most recent common ancestor. The coalescence problem is to investigate the limit behaviors of some characteristics of this most recent common ancestor such as its death time and its generation number. Moreover, in this talk, we will introduce branching random walks by imposing movement structures to the above processes and we will see what happens to the limit distribution of the positions of the particles in the branching random walks by means of the coalescence theory.\n   Mar. 8, Yi-Wen Liu Title: \"Wave phenomena in the cochlea: From micro- to macro- mechanics\" Abstract: Mammalian hearing (including humans) is sensitive to signals as weak as 10e-17 Watt. It was found that \"outer hair cells\", a special kind of sensory cells located inside the cochlea, are responsible for amplification of acoustic signals. These cells can convert mechanical energy and electrical energy in both directions, thus forming a positive feedback loop that acts as an amplifier for the traveling waves. However, it is still debatable how exactly this electro-mechanical feedback happens at the cell level. My on-going research is to construct dynamic-system models to simulate nonlinear responses of both normal and pathological ears. In this talk, I will first highlight important experimental findings in cochlear mechanics during the past 20 years or so. Then, I will present my work on modeling the micro- and macromechanics of the cochlea, and development of numerical methods thereof, so as to investigate the generation mechanisms for otoacoustic emissions (namely, sounds coming from the ear).\n   Mar. 15, Chueh-Hsin Chang Title: \"Long-time asymptotics of integrable shallow water wave equations\" Abstract: In this talk we study the topics about integrable systems. This area has many applications in shallow and deep water waves and nonlinear special functions (the Painlevé transcendents). First we introduce some basic idea about integrable systems. For example, the inverse scattering transform which is a nonlinear version of Fourier transform. Then we focus on the problems about long-time asymptotics of integrable water wave equations. Although the analytical results of asymptotics were obtained, but how long is the time need to get well approximation between analytical and asymptotic solutions is still an open problem. We construct a specified initial condition of Camassa-Holm equation and then use numerical approaches to compare the finite difference and analytical solutions to answer the above problems.\n   Mar. 22, Hung-Lung Wang Title: \"The backup 2-center problem\" Abstract: The backup 2-center problem is a center facility location problem, in which one is asked to deploy two facilities, with a given probability to fail, in a graph. Given that the two facilities do not fail simultaneously, the goal is to find two locations, possibly on edges, that minimize the expected value of the maximum of the distances from all vertices to their closest functioning facility. In this talk, we focus on the algorithmic results of this problem. In particular, we will briefly review the algorithm for computing the center of a tree, and then show how this idea is applied to solve the backup 2-center problem on a tree.\n   Mar. 29, 趙庭正 (諮商心理師) Title: \"聽與說的互動腳本－人際交往與溝通\"    Apr. 12, Daniel Eli Spector Title: \"Fractional Derivatives\" Abstract: In this talk we will discuss some of the history of fractional differentiation along with some recent advances in the area.\n   Apr. 19, Ching-Yu Chen Title: \"Modelling the outbreak of infectious disease following mutation from a non-transmissible\" Abstract: A mathematical model is derived and studied to describe the outbreak of an infectious disease which is not transmissible between humans until a mutation of the virus or bacterium takes place. The feared outbreak of a transmissible form of avian influenza leading to a global epidemic is the paradigm for this study, for which we model the mutation of the virus from a bird-human to a human-human transmissible form. An extension to the SIR approach is applied, leading to a system of ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of two classes of susceptible and infected states and a removed state. The model is analysed to determine in terms of the parameters the necessary conditions and timescales for the onset of the epidemic, the size and duration of the epidemic and the maximum level of the infected individuals at one time. Two biologically reasonable asymptotic limits are considered, 1) small mutation rate and 2) small mutation rate and small infection rate of the bird-human form. A stochastic version of the model is presented to provide alternative estimates when these rate constants are very small to account for the stochasticity. The model can be extended to investigate the effectiveness of a range of quarantine and vaccination programmes giving quantitative estimates on the outcomes of these control measures.\n   Apr. 26, Yung-Ning Peng Title: \"Branching rule, Gelfand-Tsetlin basis and 01-sequence\" Abstract: In this talk, we will recall and explain the classical branching rule of the finite dimensional irreducible $\\mathfrak{gl}_m$-module $L_m(\\lambda)$, which is about how to decompose the $L_m(\\lambda)$ into a direct sum of irreducible $\\mathfrak{gl}_{m-1}$-modules. Repeating this process, a linear basis for $L_m(\\lambda)$ is obtained, called the {\\em Gelfand-Tsetlin basis} for $L_m(\\lambda)$. We will explain an analogue of the above phenomenon when we consider the $\\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}$-module $L_{m|n}(\\lambda)$. It is a well-known fact obtained by Berele and Regev 1987 by careful calculations and combinatorial techniques. We have an alternative proof based on the representation theory of the Lie superalgebra $\\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}$. As a consequence, some interesting combinatorial identities are obtained. This talk is based on a joint work with Sean Clark and Kuang Thamrongpairoj.\n   May 10, Jung-Chao Ban Title: \"Entropy of tree shifts of finite type\" Abstract: This talk studies the entropy of tree shifts of finite type with and without boundary conditions. We demonstrate that computing the entropy of a tree shift of finite type is equivalent to solving a system of nonlinear recurrence equations. Furthermore, the entropy of binary Markov tree shifts defined on two symbols is either 0 or ln 2. Meanwhile, the realization of entropy of one-dimensional shifts of finite type is elaborated, which indicates that tree shifts are capable of rich phenomena. Considering the influence of three different types of boundary conditions, say, the periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann boundary conditions, the necessary and sufficient condition for the coincidence of entropy with and without boundary condition are addressed.\n   May 17, Daniel B. Szyld Title: \"Asynchronous Optimized Schwarz Methods for the solution of PDEs\" Abstract: Asynchronous methods refer to parallel iterative procedures where each process performs its task without waiting for other processes to be completed, i.e., with whatever information it has locally available and with no synchronizations with other processes. For the numerical solution of a general partial differential equaition on a domain, Schwarz iterative methods use a decomposition of the domain into two or more (possibly overlapping) subdomains. In essence one is introducing new artificial boundary conditions on the interfaces between these subdomains. In the classical formulation, these artificial boundary conditions are of Dirichlet type. Given an initial approximation, the method progresses by solving for the PDE restricted to each subdomain using as boundary data on the artificial interfaces the values of the solution on the neighboring subdomain from the previous step. This procedure is inherently parallel, since the (approximate) solutions on each subdomain can be performed by a different processor. In the case of optimized Schwarz, the boundary conditions on the artificial interfaces are of Robin or mixed type. In this way one can optimize the Robin parameter(s) and obtain a very fast method. In this talk, an asynchronous version of the optimized Schwarz method is presented for the solution of differential equations on a parallel computational environment. In a one-way subdivision of the computational domain, with overlap, the method is shown to converge when the optimal artificial interface conditions are used. Convergence is also proved under very mild conditions on the size of the subdomains, when approximate (non-optimal) interface conditions are utilized. Numerical results are presented on large three-dimensional problems illustrating the efficiency of the proposed asynchronous parallel implementation of the method. The main application shown is the calculation of the gravitational potential in the area around the Chicxulub crater, in Yucatan, where an asteroid is believed to have landed 66 million years ago contributing to the extintion of the dinosaurs. (Joint work with Fr\\'ederic Magou\\'es and Cedric Venet).    May 24, Yen-Liang Kuan Title: \"Criterion for deciding zeta-like multiple zeta values in positive characteristic\" Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce multiple zeta values in positive characteristic and give an effective algorithm for determining whether a given multiple zeta value is zeta-like, namely those whose ratio with the zeta value of the same weight is rational. On the other hand, we state conjectures on certain families of zeta-like multiple zeta values.    May 31, Sara Kropf Title: \"Limiting Distributions for Automata Outputs\" Abstract: We consider sequences defined as the sum of the output of an automaton. This is a generalization of automatic sequences, the sum-of-digits function and other digital sequences. We asymptotically analyze these sequences when the input of the transducer is a random integer in [0, N). Depending on properties of the automaton, the sequence is asymptotically normally distributed. We give the expected value and the variance of the sequence, including the main term and the periodic fluctuation in the second order term. We further investigate properties of this periodic fluctuation. This is joint work with Clemens Heuberger and Helmut Prodinger.    Jun. 7, Jui-Tang Chen Title: P-Laplacian on complete noncompact manifolds. Abstract: In this talk, we consider p-Laplace operators on complete noncompact manifold M. First, we define the p-parabolic ends and p-hyperbolic ends according to the p-capacity on M, which imply the volume estimates of ends with positive p-spectrum. Next, if Ricci curvature of M has the lower bound depending on the spectrum of M, we show the Liouville properties for p-harmonic functions with finite p-energy, which also infer the topological property of this manifold, that is, M has at most one p-hyperbolic end. Finally, whenever sectional curvature of M has lower bound, we prove the gradient estimate of the positive eigenfunction associated to p-Laplace operator.    Jun. 14, Gen Nakamura Title: \"Recent progress of mathematical analysis for active thermography\" Abstract: Many reconstruction schemes for inverse boundary value problems for heat equation to identify some anomalies in a heat conductor such as unknown cavities and inclusions from the measured data called Neumann to Dirichlet map have been developed. They are for examples, dynamical probe method, linear sampling type method, enclosure method etc.. One of the most attractive and important application of these reconstruction methods is to the active thermography. This is a non-contact and very quick measurement which can be repeated many times for non-destructing testing to identify anomalies inside any heat conductor. More precisely it injects a heat flux by flash lamp and measured the corresponding temperature distribution on the surface of the conductor by an infrared light camera without having any contact to the conductor. The resolution of infrared light camera is very high now a days. Hence the mathematical model of thermography fits very well to the formulation of our inverse problem. Compared with the other reconstruction schemes, the dynamical probe method and the linear sampling type method are using the most physical and effective input sources to identify the anomalies in details. It can give some possibility to provide a good basis for the active tomography. In this talk we will introduce some recent development on the dynamical probe method and linear sampling type method for active thermography. The first one and second methods are good when we probe the anomalies from their outside and inside, respectively. Based on this we will propose a true sampling method to identify an anomaly by just one measurement over a relatively short time interval.    Jun. 14, Yen-Jen Cheng Title: \"Eigenvalue problems on graphs\" Abstract: There are many applications about eigenvalues of matrices. In this talk, I will first introduce some topics about eigenvalues on graphs, and then show some our results about spectral radius on bipartite graphs.    Jun. 14, Mei-Heng Yueh Title: \"Computational Conformal Mapping with Applications on 3D Animation\" Abstract: Computational conformal mapping has been widely applied in animation industries. It provides an angle-preserving parameterization to a surface. In this talk, I will introduce some basics for computing a disk conformal mapping for a simply connected Riemann surface of single boundary, and then demonstrate some applications on 3D animation.    Jun. 14, Che-Kai Chen Title: \"Asymptotic properties of stationary Navier-Stokes flows in the setting of two dimension hyperbolic spaces\" Abstract: In this talk, I will present a piece of unpublished recent joint work with Professors Chi-Hin Chan and Magdalena Czubak. We study asymptotic properties of stationary Navier-Stokes flows on the exterior domain on hyperbolic plane. During the talk, I first mention some classical results of stationary Navier-Stokes flows passing an obstacle in the 2D-Euclidean setting. Then, I present our work which addresses the far range decay of the velocity and vorticity of the stationary Navier-Stokes flow in the hyperbolic setting.

Probabilistic Structure Learning for EEG/MEG Source Imaging with Hierarchical Graph Prior    Abstracts  Speaker Title and abstract   Sep. 17, Yu-Ting Lin Title: \"Manifold Learning in Medical Signal Processing and Challenging Problems in Engineering\" Abstract: The waveform morphology in the cardiovascular signal data reflects physiological dynamic interaction inside the human body. By organizing the subtle change of waveform morphology from large amount of data, unsupervised manifold learning help delineate a high dimensional structure. Using diffusion map, we may gain more insight for signal processing, data analysis and classification. Development in engineering warrants the reliability of clinical application. Therefore, I will present several challenging problems for further discussion.\n   Sep. 24, Yi-Hsuan Lin Title: \"Inverse problems and partial differential equations.\" Abstract: In this talk we will introduce several inverse problems, such as the famous Calder\\'on problem. Roughly speaking, inverse problems investigate the question of determining the interior physical information of a medium from its boundary measurements. Furthermore, we also introduce linear, non-linear and non-local inverse problems in this talk.\n   Oct. 1, Hsieh-Chen Tsai Title: \"An strongly-coupled immersed-boundary formulation for rigid-bodies interacting with fluid flow\" Abstract: We present a strongly-coupled immersed-boundary method for flow–structure interaction problems involving rigid bodies. The method is stable for arbitrary choices of solid-to-fluid mass ratios and for large rigid-body motions. Dynamics of rigid bodies is characterized by the velocity of the center of mass and the angular velocity about the center of mass, which are governed by the translational and rotational equations of motion involving boundary forces. By introducing the summation and distribution operators, equations of motion are coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations through the no-slip constraint and boundary forces. Boundary forces are regarded as Lagrange multipliers that enable the no-slip constraint to be implicitly determined to arbitrary precision without associated time-step restrictions. Through projections, the current method removes not only slip component of the velocity field but also components of rigid-body dynamics that do not satisfy equations of motion. We verify our method by simulating the free fall of a circular cylinder and further apply our method for investigating the starting of a flow-driven vertical-axis wind turbine.    Oct. 1, Jack Koolen Title: \"On the classification of Q-polynomial distance-regular graphs\" Abstract: In the early 1980 Bannai asked whether the Q-polynomial distance-regular graphs with large diameter can be classified. In this talk I will first give an overview what is known. If there is time I will discuss some open problems.\n   Oct. 15, Ray-Bing Chen Title: \"Global Optimization of Expensive Functions Using Adaptive RBF-Based Surrogate Model via Uncertainty Quantification\" Abstract: Global optimization of expensive functions has important applications in physical and computer experiments. It is a challenging problem to develop efficient optimization scheme, because each function evaluation can be costly and the derivative information of the function is often not available. We propose a novel global optimization framework using adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBF) based surrogate model via uncertainty quantification. The framework consists of two iteration steps. It first employs an RBF-based Bayesian surrogate model to approximate the true function, where the parameters of the RBFs can be adaptively estimated and updated each time a new point is explored. Then it utilizes a model-guided selection criterion to identify a new point from a candidate set for function evaluation. The selection criterion adopted here is a sample version of the expected improvement (EI) criterion. We conduct simulation studies with standard test functions, which show that the proposed method is more efficient and stable in searching the global optimizer than two existing methods.\n   Oct. 22, Mark Blyth Title: \"Critical free surface flow over topography\" Abstract: Two-dimensional free-surface flow over a localised bottom topography is examined with an emphasis on calculating steady, forced solitary-wave solutions. In particular we focus on the case of a Gaussian dip topography. Most of the focus is on the weakly-nonlinear limit where a forced KdV equation is applicable, and the problem essentially boils down to solving a forced nonlinear ODE with a single parameter that quantifies the amplitude of the topography. This equation has a rich solution space with a large (probably infinite) number of solution branches. Asymptotic analysis for small topography amplitude reveal some interesting features, for example an internal boundary layer which mediates a change from exponential to algebraic decay of the free-surface in the far-field. Traditional boundary-layer theory fails beyond the first two solution branches, where the surface profiles feature multiple waves trapped over the topography. The stability of the steady solutions will also be briefly discussed.\n   Oct. 29, Chia-Chieh Chu Title: \"淺談數學對產業界的影響與可壓縮歐拉方程接近真空解的研究\" Abstract: 這個演講分成兩個部分，前半段分享美國工業與應用數學會（Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics，簡稱 SIAM）在2012年發表了一篇報告: 產業中的數學(SIAM Report on Mathematics in Industry)。他們發現不論是在傳統或嶄新產業，數學與科學計算皆有愈來愈多的應用。這些應用會對公司的盈虧造成極大幅的影響。我將跟大家分享我個人的經驗裡數學在哪些產業與應用提供了什麼貢獻，並且稍微介紹計算數學的一些核心思想。 後半段我介紹近期在可壓縮歐拉方程問題中，解接近真空時的一個簡化模型。在這研究中我們提中一個新的角度來思考當密度接近0時，如何逼近歐拉方程的解。我們提出的簡化模型可以解決Glimm方法中，因為解接近真空而造成逼近解的總變化量過大的問題。進而證明了當初使密度夠小時，歐拉方程的解都會在O(1)時間存在。這份工作是與中央大學洪盟凱教授與李信儀博士一起完成的。\n   Nov. 12, Yen-Huan Li Title: \"Towards efficient and rigorous learning with the logarithmic loss\" Abstract: Minimizing the logarithmic loss is an essential task to many applications, such as positron emission tomography, optimal portfolio selection, and quantum state tomography. The optimization problems are indeed convex. However, the logarithmic loss violates standard smoothness assumptions in optimization literature, so most existing optimization algorithms and/or their convergence guarantees do not directly apply. In this talk, I will introduce some of our recent developments in addressing the logarithmic loss.    Nov. 19, Jeng-Nan Tseng Title: \"A gentleintroduction to numerical error\" Abstract: To understand and manipulate the numerical error is an important issue in scientific computing. The behavior of errors is various and interesting. Errors are not always a bad things in applications. In this lecture, I will introduce some interesting and unexpected examples. Moreover, some useful applications designed by the numerical error will be shown.\n   Nov. 26, Yi-Ren Yeh Title: \"機器學習實務案例分享\" Abstract: 透過大量的資料取得與電腦計算能力的增強，資料科學的研究領域近年來在學界與產業界裡均受到高度的重視，許多在機器學習與資料探勘中被提出來的預測模型也確實滿足了不少在資料分析上的需求，而機器學習如何落地也是大家很關注的議題。這次的演講主要是分享過去與業界產學合作的經驗，包含金融核貸、資料安全與物聯網相關的議題。\n   Dec. 3, Ching-Sung Liu Title: \"The numerical methods for nonlinear eigenvalue problems\" Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce nonlinear eigenvalue problems, including tensor eigenvalue problems and nonlinear Schrödinger equations. We will discuss its numerical methods and some numerical results. A great advantage of this method is that it converges quadratically and is positivity preserving in the sense that the vectors approximating the Perron vector (or the ground state vector) are strictly positive in each iteration.\n   Dec. 10, C.-Y. Hsieh Title: \"Singular Solutions to Some Semilinear Elliptic Equations: An Approach of Born-Infeld Approximation\" Abstract: We construct singular solutions to a semilinear elliptic equation with exponential nonlinearity on a bounded domain in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. To show the existence of singular solutions, we introduce an inverse problem and utilize a Born-Infeld approximation scheme. Ruling out a possible occurrence of bubbling phenomenon, we show that as the Born-Infeld parameter tends to infinity, solutions of the inverse problem on a subdomain with finitely many holes can be used to approximate singular solutions to the original problem. Our work rigorously justifies the Born-Infeld-Higgs approximation to the abelian Maxwell-Higgs theory. This is a joint work with Yong Yu and Ho Man Tai (CUHK).\n   Dec. 17, Ya-Lun Tsai Title: \"Three points of view in solving polynomial systems\" Abstract: In this talk, I will first describe briefly my backgrounds about how to encounter such a fascinating topic of solving polynomial systems. Three different tools, Sylvester resultants, Wu’s method, and Groebner bases will be introduced as different viewpoints in solving polynomial systems. Some applications to point vortex problems and N-body problems will be prevented.\n   Dec. 17, Li Wang Title: \"Probabilistic Structure Learning for EEG/MEG Source Imaging with Hierarchical Graph Prior\" Abstract: Brain source imaging is an important method for noninvasively characterizing brain activity using Electroencephalogram (EEG) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Traditional EEG/MEG Source Imaging (ESI) methods usually assume that either source activities at different time points are unrelated, or that similar spatiotemporal patterns exist across an entire study period. The former assumption makes ESI analyses sensitive to noise, while the latter renders ESI analyses unable to account for time-varying patterns of activity. To effectively deal with noise while maintaining flexibility and continuity among brain activation patterns, we propose a novel probabilistic ESI model based on a hierarchical graph prior. In our method, a spanning tree constraint is imposed to ensure that activity patterns have spatiotemporal continuity. An efficient algorithm based on alternating convex search is presented to solve the proposed model and is provably convergent. Comprehensive numerical studies using synthetic data on a real brain model are conducted under different levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from both sensor and source spaces. We also examine the EEG/MEG data from two real applications, in which our ESI reconstructions are neurologically plausible. All results demonstrate significant improvements of the proposed algorithm over the benchmark methods in terms of source localization performance, especially at high noise levels.
