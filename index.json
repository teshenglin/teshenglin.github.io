The flow structures are analysed first using a long-wave model, which is valid in the presence of weak inertia, and second using the Stokes equations. For obtuse angles, gravity is destabilising and solitary pulses exist even in the absence of an electric field. For acute angles, spatially non-uniform solutions exist only beyond a critical value of the electric field strength; moreover, solitary-pulse solutions are present only at sufficiently high supercritical electric-field strengths. The electric field increases the amplitude of the pulses, can generate recirculation zones in the humps and alters the far-field decay of the pulse tails from exponential to algebraic with a significant impact on pulse interactions. A weak-interaction theory predicts an infinite sequence of bound-state solutions for non-electrified flow, and a finite set for electrified flow. The existence of single-hump pulse solutions and two-pulse bound states is confirmed for the Stokes equations via boundary-element computations. In addition, the electric field is shown to trigger a switch from absolute to convective instability, thereby regularising the dynamics, and this is confirmed by time-dependent simulations of the long-wave model.","tags":[],"title":"Two-dimensional pulse dynamics and the formation of bound states on electrified falling films","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.-S.

Such a system can be considered as a prototype for many other systems where the interplay of spatial heterogeneity and a lateral driving force in the proximity of a first- or second-order phase transition results in intri- cate behavior. So does a partially wetting drop on a rotating cylinder undergo a depinning transition as the rotation speed is increased, whereas for ideally wetting liquids, the behavior only changes quantitatively. We analyze the bifurcations that occur when the rotation speed is increased for several values of the equilibrium contact angle of the partially wetting liquids. This allows us to discuss how the entire bifurcation structure and the flow behavior it encodes change with changing wettability. We employ various numerical continuation techniques that allow us to track stable/unstable steady and time-periodic film and drop thickness profiles. We support our findings by time-dependent numerical simulations and asymptotic analyses of steady and time-periodic profiles for large rotation numbers.","tags":[],"title":"Bifurcation analysis of the behavior of partially wetting liquids on a rotating cylinder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Transversally invariant ridges located on the more wettable stripes are identified as very important transient states and their linear stability is analyzed accompanied by direct numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear evolution equation for two-dimensional substrates. It is found that there exist two different instability modes that lead to different nonlinear evolutions that result (i) at large ridge volume in the formation of bulges that spill from the more wettable stripes onto the less wettable bare substrate and (ii) at small ridge volume in the formation of small droplets located on the more wettable stripes. In addition, the influence of different transport mechanisms during redistribution is investigated focusing on the cases of convective transport with no-slip at the substrate, transport via diffusion in the film bulk and via diffusion at the film surface. In particular, it is shown that the transport process does neither influence the linear stability thresholds nor the sequence of morphologies observed in the time simulation, but only the ratio of the time scales of the different process phases.","tags":[],"title":"Instabilities of layers of deposited molecules on chemically stripe patterned substrates: Ridges vs. drops","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

As for the local generalized Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (gKS) equation (see, e.g., [T. Kawahara and S. Toh, Phys. Fluids, 31 (1988), pp. 2103–2111]), we show that sufficiently strong dispersion regularizes the chaotic dynamics of the KS equation, and the solutions evolve into arrays of interacting pulses that can form bound states. We analyze the asymptotic characteristics of such pulses and show that their tails tend to zero al- gebraically but not exponentially, as for the local gKS equation. Since the Shilnikov-type approach is not applicable for analyzing bound states in nonlocal equations, we develop a weak-interaction theory and show that the standard first-neighbor approximation is no longer applicable. It is then essential to take into account long-range interactions due to the algebraic decay of the tails of the pulses. In addition, we find that the number of possible bound states for fixed parameter values is always finite, and we determine when there is long-range attractive or repulsive force between the pulses. Finally, we explain the regularizing effect of dispersion by showing that, as dispersion is increased, the pulses generally undergo a transition from absolute to convective instability. We also find that for some nonlocal operators, increasing the strength of the stabilizing/destabilizing term can have a regularizing/deregularizing effect on the dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Coherent structures in non-local dispersive active-dissipative systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.
